## Hey there! 👋  
I'm Ibtihaj — a Computer Science student and graphic designer.

I design and build digital experiences using code and creativity.

If an idea excites me, I turn it into a project and ship it.

My focus is web development, UI/UX, and branding.  
Currently learning how to build real-world products, not just assignments.
